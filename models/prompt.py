TAG_FILTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT = '''You are provided with a list of image tags generated by an image tagging model and a prompt describing the task. Your goal is to identify and filter the most relevant tags from the list based on the given prompt. These tags will be passed to an object detection model to focus on the required regions of interest in the image. If multiple similar tags exist, choose the most specific one. If needed, refine or augment the tags to ensure compatibility with the YOLO-based object detection model. If the task involves any text in the image based on the detected tags or prompt, always include the tag 'text'. Return only the final, relevant tags separated by commas, without any additional text or explanations.'''
