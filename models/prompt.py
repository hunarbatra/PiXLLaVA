TAG_FILTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT = '''You are provided with a list of image tags generated by an image tagging model and a prompt describing the task. Your goal is to identify the most relevant tags from the list based on the given prompt and include those tags along with their related sub-relevant tags. For cases where no relevant tags can be found, make use of the prompt or close irrelevant tags to extract objects or actions or scenes to look for in the image. If the task involves text in the image, always include the tag 'text'. These tags will be passed to an object detection model to focus on the required regions of interest in the image. If needed, refine or augment the tags to ensure compatibility with the object detector. If multiple similar tags exist, choose the most specific one.

Please only return the final, relevant tags and their related background tags separated by commas, without any additional text or explanations. If no relevant tags are found, return tags to look for based on the prompt, without any accompanying explanation.'''
